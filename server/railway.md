# Railway Configuration for Node.js Backend
# This file tells Railway how to deploy your backend

# Build settings are automatically detected for Node.js
# No explicit configuration needed for simple Express apps

# Railway will:
# 1. Detect Node.js environment
# 2. Run npm install automatically
# 3. Start the app using package.json "start" script
# 4. Expose the app on the PORT environment variable

# Environment variables to set in Railway dashboard:
# - MONGODB_URI
# - JWT_SECRET
# - NODE_ENV=production
